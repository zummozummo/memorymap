Mongoose create easy to use object Refrence when intracting with mongodb
our database gets modeled within our code.

How do we use mongoose.
1)create a Schema

Schema types (fields)
A schema can have an arbitrary number of fields â€”
each one represents a field in the documents stored in MongoDB. 
An example schema showing many of the common field types and how they are declared is shown below.
eg- var BookSchema=new Schema({
    title:String,
    keywords:Array,
    published:Boolean
});
module.exports=mongoose.model('Book',BookSchema);

we need to create a instance of the schema and we call this 
instance model.
2)with schema setup we only have to connect to mongodb.

Using models
Once you've created a schema you can use it to create models. 
The model represents a collection of documents in the database that you can search, 
while the model's instances represent individual documents that you can save and retrieve.

Creating and modifying documents
To create a record you can define an instance of the model and then call save(). The examples below 
assume SomeModel is a model (with a single field "name") that we have created from our schema.
